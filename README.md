# Fruit-Freshness-Detection-
A multi-task deep learning model that predicts fruit freshness from images by performing two tasks: 1) Classification: Fresh vs Rotten 2) Regression: Days remaining until spoilage Using a fine-tuned ResNet50, the system processes the dataset, trains both tasks, and outputs evaluation metrics and a final trained model.
